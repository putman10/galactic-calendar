# _Galactic Calendar_

#### _Returns your age on all the planets of the solar system , 8/3/18_

#### By _**Ryan Putman**_

## Description

* _This application will allow users to enter their birthday in earth years. The program will convert and calculate the equivalent age on the different planets of the solar system_<br>
* _Due to the rotational speed of the different planets a year is not 365 days on all of the planets meaning our age is relative to the planet we are on._<br>
* _Information about individual planet's rotation can be found at http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/age.shtml_


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download project from the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/putman10/galactic-calendar.git _
* _Install Node.js through terminal with Homebrew on mac using the command $ brew install node_
* _If on Windows installtion instructions for Node.js can be found here: https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/javascript/getting-started-with-javascript-2f9a73dc-b7f5-4a22-9101-e69d49f552ac/installing-node-js _
* _Open project folder in terminal and run $ npm install _
* _In terminal run $npm run start _

## User Stories - MVP

* _Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds._
* _Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)_
* _Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy._
* _If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy._

## User Stories - Additional features for future implementation
* _Add a UI to your application._
* _Return the date of a user’s next birthday on each planet._
* _Return the age Keith Richards will be in dog years on the planet Jupiter in 2073._
* _Assuming that the average lifespan of a mayfly is 5 minutes, determine how many mayfly lifespans a human user has lived and then compare it the current age (in Earth years) of our sun._
* _Make your application look nice and give it a solar theme!_
